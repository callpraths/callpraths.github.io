Hi,

My name is Prathmesh Prabhu.

I've been fortunate to live in various parts of India, United States, and now Canada.

I've also been fortunate to dabble in computer science, economics, and software engineering.

As I've wandered geographically and in my interests, so has the content and style of my writing. This blog houses some of that.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/callpraths), or just [email me](mailto:callpraths@gmail.com).
I no longer use this other [GitHub](https://github.com/prprabhu-ms) or [Chromium](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/q/owner:pprabhu%2540chromium.org) or this [typeset grad school website](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~pprabhu/), though some of my past activity is visible there.
