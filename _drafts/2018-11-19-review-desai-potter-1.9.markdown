Development studies as a field has undergone a fundamental change of focus since it inception in the first half of 20th century. Some of the earlier
posts on this blog describe the critiques that necessitate a reformulation of the goals and techniques of the field. I now look at the moral
dimension of the modern reformulation of development studies to understand resulting challenges to the general applicability of policy recommendations
from the field across the world.

The original focus of development studies was restricted to economic development of hitherto underdeveloped regions of the world. Other aspects of
human society like civil and political rights, income distribution and its relation to social structures and environment externalities from
development were of no concern to the policy recommendations advanced by the scholars. This stance has changed radically since the impasse in
development studies research. Goulet [insert-link] summarizes the new expanded scope of development studies by coining three basic needs that all
development projects must aspire to meet for the population of the target regions -- _life sustenance_, _self-esteem_ and _freedom_. The first, _life
sustenance_ is an extension of the economic development centered view of original scholars but the focus now shifts to provision of basic physical
needs of the population -- food security, shelter and health services -- as well as supporting human capital growth via primary education and
development of employment opportunities. In concrete terms, this implies a renewed interest in ensuring some fairness in income distribution along
with overall economic growth of the nation. The second dimension of _self-esteem_ applies to the nation as a whole and aims to provide a voice for the
people of the nation on the increasingly integrated global forum. Concerns along this dimension include protection from exploitation by other nations,
prevention of slavery and colonialism in both its obvious and implicit forms, and creation of opportunity for true national growth in the context of
global trade relations. The final dimension of _freedom_, returning to the personal realm, hints at the fruits of development in the dimensions
discussed so far -- the expansion of personal freedom defined as an expansion of choice for the general population in the material, social and
political arenas.

The three dimensions mentioned above can be seen to be layered in some ways. Basic life sustenance needs must be met before a stable nation can exist
and the concerns of a level playing ground on the internaional field can arise. Similarly, basic needs and space for national growth are prerequisites
for any sustained effort to expand personal freedoms. While these statements are generally true, the three dimensions are interconnected more deeply.
Expectations and levels of personal freedom often feed back into the political organization of the nation which affects the provision of basic needs
and a sense of national pride. So, development in each dimensions builds on top of others and both development and underdevelopment in a
dimension has positive feedback on other dimensions.

The three dimensions can be seen to be heirarchical in a different way -- in their moral content. Each dimension is loaded with increasing
prescriptions for the morality of a "developed" society, and hence faces increasing counter-pressure from opposing voices that reject the implicit
morality. The goal of meeting basic needs for life sustenance are in theory the most generally accepted, and the United Nations have developed
several indicators of nations' performance with regards to provision of these basic needs including the Human Development Index and the Human Poverty Index.
But even those have met with stiff opposition from neo-classical economics. Nations all over the world, including in underdeveloped nations, have
increasingly adopted economic policies of economic liberalization that have led to worsening of income inequality. An extension of the neo-classical
bent in global eco-political leadership is the de-facto failure of all affirmative action to bolster the voice of under-developed nations in
international organizations like World Trade Organization and the United Nations. On the contrary, both the World Trade Organization and International
Monetary Fund have been criticized for forcing economic and political restructuring of indebted underdeveloped nations that always contravenes these
nations' sovereignty and has been shown to be detrimental to the nations' long term progress in some cases.

The final dimension of _freedom_ is the most controversial in terms of its moral prescriptions, and because this dimension characterizes the end-goal
of the other dimensions, it opens up a heated debate about the general applicability of development efforts. Just like the early years of development
studies, the field is dominated by Northern scholars, and as any discussion of this final dimension of the scope of the field demonstrates, is laden
with moral judgements by these scholards that stem from their social context. The importance accorded to personal liberty in development literature
often stands in opposition to existing religious and traditional fabric in some eastern societies where individuality is subordinate to observance of
social roles and maintenance of familial cohesion. The assumption that expanded choice is synonymous with social progress is also opposed to certain
ethics that prescribe a simple life as the good life and proscribe material access. This final point is particularly problematic for Amartya Sen's
operationalization of freedom-as-progress via an expansion of the fundamental utility theory in economics to encompass all the ways in which progress
leads to peoples' ability to fulfil a wider range of desires. Even the undisputed ascedence of democracy as the liberating form of self governance is
merely a preference often clothed as fact. A case in point is the difficulty faced when attemtping to settle on a universal definition for  _human
rights_. Any such exercise is frought with the possibility of stalemate due to conflicting moral views, and an eventual definition is likely to be a
compromise that is yet a victory of the most politically powerful groups on the international stage, viz., the Northern states.

Notwithstanding these reservations, poverty, deprevation and inequality are real circumstances with very real consequences for those affected. As XXX
puts it,

The rich may endure the uncertainty of deconstruction, but the poor very well know what poverty feels like.

So where to from here for development scholars? Do we dither in our definitions and circumscribe our recommendations to the detriment of effectiveness
of pro-development policy (like the defeat of reasonable economics to the new-liberal dogma), or do we risk imposition of a moral code unwanted in
those we seek to _help_? In my opinion, pursuit of progress is a moral cause and an attempt at rendering the goals objective is doomed. We must accept
the moral position we hold when we advocate for a certain kind of progress, stating our baises front-and-center. Further, we should strive to
encourage participation of the _emancipated_ in defining what emancipation means for them, but within the moral standards alerady chosen. Finally, the
tools and measurements employed can and should be entirely scientific, lending credibility to our achievements towards progress.
