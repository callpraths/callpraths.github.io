Development studies as a field has undergone a fundamental change of focus since it inception in the first half of 20th century. Some of the earlier
posts on this blog describe the critiques that necessitate a reformulation of the goals and techniques of the field. I now look at the moral
dimension of the modern reformulation of development studies to understand resulting challenges to the general applicability of policy recommendations
from the field across the world.

The original focus of development studies was restricted to economic development of hitherto underdeveloped regions of the world. Other aspects of
human society like civil and political rights, income distribution and its relation to social structures and environment externalities from
development were of no concern to the policy recommendations advanced by the scholars. This stance has changed radically since the impasse in
development studies research. Goulet [insert-link] summarizes the new expanded scope of development studies by coining three basic needs that all
development projects must aspire to meet for the population of the target regions -- _life sustenance_, _self-esteem_ and _freedom_. The first, _life
sustenance_ is an extension of the economic development centered view of original scholars but the focus now shifts to provision of basic physical
needs of the population -- food security, shelter and health services -- as well as supporting human capital growth via primary education and
development of employment opportunities. In concrete terms, this implies a renewed interest in ensuring some fairness in income distribution along
with overall economic growth of the nation. The second dimension of _self-esteem_ applies to the nation as a whole and aims to provide a voice for the
people of the nation on the increasingly integrated global forum. Concerns along this dimension include protection from exploitation by other nations,
prevention of slavery and colonialism in both its obvious and implicit forms, and creation of opportunity for true national growth in the context of
global trade relations. The final dimension of _freedom_, returning to the personal realm, hints at the fruits of development in the dimensions
discussed so far -- the expansion of personal freedom defined as an expansion of choice for the general population in the material, social and
political arenas.

The three dimensions mentioned above can be seen to be layered in some ways. Basic life sustenance needs must be met before a stable nation can exist
and the concerns of a level playing ground on the internaional field can arise. Similarly, basic needs and space for national growth are prerequisites
for any sustained effort to expand personal freedoms. While these statements are generally true, the three dimensions are interconnected more deeply.
Expectations and levels of personal freedom often feed back into the political organization of the nation which affects the provision of basic needs
and a sense of national pride. So, development in each dimensions builds on top of others and both development and underdevelopment in a
dimension has positive feedback on other dimensions.

The three dimensions can be seen to be heirarchical in a different way -- in their moral content. Each dimension is loaded with increasing
prescriptions for the morality of a "developed" society, and hence faces increasing counter-pressure from opposing voices that reject the implicit
morality. The goal of meeting basic needs for life sustenance are in theory the most generally accepted, but even those have met with stiff opposition
from neo-classical economics. Nations all over the world, including in underdeveloped nations, have increasingly adopted economic policies of economic
liberalization that have led to worsening of income inequality. An extension of the neo-classical bent in global eco-political leadership is the
de-facto failure of all affirmative action to bolster the voice of under-developed nations in international organizations like World Trade
Organization and the United Nations. On the contrary, both the World Trade Organization and International Monetary Fund have been criticized for
forcing economic and political restructuring of indebted underdeveloped nations that always contravenes these nations' sovereignty and has been shown
to be detrimental to the nations' long term progress in some cases.

The final dimension of _freedom_ is the most controversial in terms of its moral prescriptions, and because this dimension characterizes the end-goal
of the other dimensions, it opens up a heated debate about the general applicability of development efforts. Just like the early years of development
studies, the field is dominated by Northern scholars, and as any discussion of this final dimension of the scope of the field demonstrates, is laden
with moral judgements by these scholards that stem from their social context. The 

- Tie in human rights.
- Discuss Sen in this context.
- Mention how the poor can't participate in these discussions -- they know what poverty is like.

- Where to from here for us then? Take a moral stance, clearly state is as such. Then work for it unabashed. Do not try to hide the fact that it is a
  moral science, and do not push it down peoples' throats. Let them decide for themselves where they want their life to be. Be very *very* wary of
playing the big brother. I'm looking at you, America.
