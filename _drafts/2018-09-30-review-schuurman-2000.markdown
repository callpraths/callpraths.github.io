Notes

* Paradigm shift in development studies in the 1980s: The impasse.
* Three essential paradigms lost:
  * Essentialisation of third world.
    * No longer able to treat third world as homogeneous: Unlike economics these
      guys weren't thinking of simplified models, or weren't trying to
      understand how the simplifying assumptions affect their conclusions.
    * This was brought down in part due to attacks by deconstructionists
      (Focoult et al). But there are unintended consequences. Development
      studies scholars started avoiding talking about the "inequality in the
      third world" because it became taboo. Instead talked about "diversity in
      the third world", but the latter concept was never well defined and had no
      strong theoretical underpinnings. So, a simplified but well defined
      concept was replaced by a touchy-feely compromise to make the attackers
      happy. 
      * My philosophy book [insert reference] has something to say about this --
	post-deconstructionist philosophy must be a reflexive humanistic
	philosophy, without wavering from the goals set forth pre
	deconstructionism. What does it mean in this context?
    * Author's response: 
      This quote paraphrases the author's take
      > There is only a very thin line between tolerance (in the sense of
      > accepting diversity) and cultural relativism where we tolerate each
      > other but have nothing to say to each other anymore.
      * The essence of development studies is in the recognizing inequality and
	working towards emancipation of groups of socially ostracized groups in
	the South. Diversity of experiences does not nullify this goal.
      * The recognition of diversity is important, but an active treatment of
	the relevance of these difference for the given research question
	matters.
  * Faith in the notion of progress broken.
    * Mostly, people gave up. Despite a few decades of incomplete efforts,
      development efforts have led to worsening of the inequalities, so people
      lost hope.
    * There are various forms in which this changed the discourse.
      * Some authors reject the need for developing the third world countries,
	preferring the status quo, or some wooly notion of diversity to
	progress. I think that these authors are guilty of blindness of one of
	two kinds: either they are armchair scholars who are already comfortable
	from the fruits of progress and find it easy to prefer non-development
	for others, or they are people in under-developed countries who find the
	status quo to their advantage.
      * Other forms are a fatalistic view that the end is neigh and it is too
	late for any meaningful progress and a euro-centric view that considers
	the risk of the development project for the third world as too high --
	due to the known high externalities of modernization -- not realizing
	that citizens in the third world already live in a world with high risk
	and the risk is a concern only for those in the developed world.
    * Author's response:
      * Unrealistic and convenient for researchers in the developed world to
	just "help the poor forget the 'first world' needs".
      * The idea that development of the world entails risk is specious:
        * South lived with the same risk through colonisation. For the South,
	  the risk is equal whether they modernize or not.
	* It is only when the risk which was so far outsourced to South
	  threatens the North that risk is factored into the calculations around
	  cost-benefit of development.
	* Once again, fatalistic. Humans got us here, they ought to get us
	  ought.
  * Third pillar: The central place of state in development.
    * Political science, economics and cultural studies all developed
      concomitant to the rise of nation-state and as such theories explicitly
      intertwined with the notion of a powerful state actor.
      * All three are seeing changes. Politics is moving to civil society,
	economics is looking for behavioural and sociological roots, cultural
	studies are focus on identity construction.
    * State is disappearing politically (lack of sovereignty from above, focus
      on local governance from below), economically (trans-national private
      firms) and culturally (again both cosmopolitanism and ethnic, regional
      dogma)
    * Author's response:
      * Effective local governments presuppose a phase of nation building and a
	phase of welfare state. These ensure that the small local governments
	have a big brother to protect them from large transnational concerns.
	These are western ideals being injected into South, where they do mere
	lip service. When local governments do blossom in the South, they fall
	prey to competition for huge entities internationally.
	* I can affirm this and elucidate with examples.
      * About civil society. This paradigm needs more explication before it is
	useful. Civil society originally was associated with seeding democracy
	in an undemocratic society. But it consists of loosely held organisation
	with not enough agency to replace the state.

I will quote the final conclusion as is:

> The challenge for development studies is to re-establish is relevance to study
> and to understand processes of exclusion, emancipation and development -- not
> particularly by clinging to its once treasured paradigms but by incorporating
> creatively the new Zeitgeist without giving up on its normative basis, i.e.,
> the awareness that only with a universal morality of justice is there [sic] is
> a future for humanity.

i.e., the humanist perspective is the central tenet of development studies which
helps keep the light on.
