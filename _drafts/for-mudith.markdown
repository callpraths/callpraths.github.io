I will

- Create a safe and loving environment that will always be a home for him.
- Guide him gently and consistently so that he will be grow up to be a morally conscious man.
- Provide him the opportunities to grow where he shows promise.


I will not

- Isolate (or _protect_) him from his environment. It is a lost cause that only causes alienation all around.
- Live my life through him, or sacrifice my happiness for him. I will build happiness with him, and include him in all I want for myself.
- Have any expectations from him as a grown man. Kids take, you give. Period.
