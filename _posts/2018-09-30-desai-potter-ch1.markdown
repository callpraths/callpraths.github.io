Klaus Dodds opens their essay on the impact of Cold war on nations of the world
with the assertion that words have power. The cold war was a period of struggle
for ideological and eco-political dominance of the world between the two richest
nations of the time - United States and Soviet Union. Both US and USSR, vying
for control over nations of the world, deployed dual pronged
inteventions -- abetting the goals of various nations (development related and
otherwise) through financial and technological aid on the one hand, and exerting
control over nations on the other hand via war, political insurgency and
inciting revolution when they deemed the nations antagonistic to their agenda.
These interactions have come to label the different nations of the world in
different ways with the undercurrent of separating the haves from the have-nots.
Various labels for the developing countries included in the chapter topic serve
the dual goal of bolstering the already uneven standing of nations in various
global forums like the WTO and IMF, while at the same time labeling
actual inequality of power opens up the possibility of dialogue and affirmative
action to help the countries most in need.

The end of cold war with the folding of USSR in 1990, Klaus notes, brought hope
of a possible attempt to directly address the humanitarian crises in the least
developed nations and bring about a global attempt to help nations develop for
the purpose of betterment of the citizens, rather than the dual carrot-stick
treatment by the powerful nations towards their own goals. This hope has been
mostly for naught. The US is once again embrolied in a "war on terror" with a
similar categorization of friendly and antagonistic countries, and a similar
inefficient arbitrary flow of aid and war onto smaller nations.

I find the expectation that powerful nations would aid development of poorer
nations for humanitarian causes naive. Humans are a tribal species and nations
have seldom shown the empathy to help other nations prosper for selfless
reasons. Even partial attempts to extend the nations' concern oversees often
lead to domestic backlash as resources are seen to be squandered while the
"situation at home" is seen to be dire. The result is Trump.

Any attempt to improve the lot of their citizens must be driven from
within the global South. Non Alignment Movement was one such attempt during the
heyday of cold war when the developing nations realized the net loss to their
sovereignty and long term well-being from the polarized dominance of the two
superpowers. NAM failed to keep the countries together meaningfully because it
was unable to account for the heterogeneity of nations in the South and was
unable to empathize with and tackle the paucity of resources these nations had
for collective bargaining. In order to achieve development goals in line with
the less powerful nations' disparate requirements, these nations must create and
maintain a platform that provides them collective bargaining power against the
richer states that otherwise stipulate global policy by default through their
superior resource allocation for this purpose. The dominance of rich nations in
WTO and IMF and the often criticized impact of IMF policies on developing
nations' social trajectories is a case in point.

At the same time, I think it is important to note, as the text does, the
material progress that has in fact occurred in the global South in the last
century. A large part of the global population has access to more and better
quality material resources than their ancestors. Even though IMF stipulated
market restructuring tramples on nations' sovereignty, perhaps it delivers on
the promise of progress? Validation of true development on ground, it's impact
on the people in the global South, and the cost in terms of long term self
sufficiency and resource extraction are important and difficult questions to
consider. A somewhat exaggerated analogy to the North-led and North-dependent
progress of the world is the century old model of imperialist colonization. Are
global interactions triggered by the cold war, and continuing past its end, just
another form of imperialism? And if so, do we consider the cost-benefit of
imperialist colonization worthwhile for the colonized? For example, the British
were responsible for the extensive rail network in the Indian subcontinent -- an
enduring piece of critical infrastructure for the modern Indian economy -- but
we unanimously consider independence from foreign yoke a step in the right
direction for the nation. It seems that self sufficiency is implicitly
considered an important part of a nation's progress and the cold war driven
global order does not provide space for most nations to grow in that regard.
