In his essay [The Economics of Climate Change], Noam Chomsky says, while
discussing essential strategies to bolster functioning democracies

> A longer-term goal is to win the educational and cultural battle that's been
> waged with such bitterness in the one-sided class war. It means tearing down
> the enormous edifice of delusions about markets, free trade, and democracy
> that's been assiduously constructed over many years, and to overcome the
> marginalization and atomization of the public.

This is indeed a valid and sufficient goal for a labour centric study of
economics. To shed light on the critical underlying assumptions associated with
inevitability and benignity of the larger Capitalistic structure. Instead, to
focus on some exogenous goals for the world economic order and from their model
the economically sound mechanisms that may be useful in guiding the invisible
hand in a moral direction.

The antidote to runaway Capitalism is unlikely to be Socialism (or any other
-ism). Rather, economists can help understand the stakeholders and the stakes
that drive the overall implicit and post-hoc system goals of the world economy
and develop means to guide these goals in directions determined by humanitarian
considerations.
