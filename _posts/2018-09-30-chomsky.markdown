In his essay [The Economics of Climate Change], Noam Chomsky says, while
discussing essential strategies to bolster functioning democracies

> A longer-term goal is to win the educational and cultural battle that's been
> waged with such bitterness in the one-sided class war. It means tearing down
> the enormous edifice of delusions about markets, free trade, and democracy
> that's been assiduously constructed over many years, and to overcome the
> marginalization and atomization of the public.

It is indeed a valid and sufficient goal for a labour centric study of
economics to shed light on the assumptions underlying the notions of
inevitability and benignity of the Capitalistic enterprise. Amartya Sen has said
that there is no positivist economics. Economists must choose intentionally the
moral goals for the world economic order and from there model economically sound
mechanisms that may be useful in guiding the invisible hand in that moral
direction.

For me, this harkens back to lyrics from the song _Epitaph_ of progressive rock
band King Crimson:

>  Knowledge is a deadly friend
>
>  If no one sets the rules
>
>  The fate of all mankind I see
>
>  Is in the hands of fools

The antidote to runaway capitalism is unlikely to be socialism (or any other
-ism). Rather, economists can help understand the stakeholders and the stakes
that drive the overall implicit and post-hoc system goals of the world economy
and develop means to guide these goals in directions determined by humanitarian
considerations.
