## Theories, strategies, and ideologies

Different development related discourses can be classified as pertaining to development theories, strategies, or ideologies. 

- Development _theories_ are dissertations about how development has occurred in the past, or could or should happen in the future. Theories can be
  positive in nature, mostly studying what has occurred, or may occur, but most development theories tend to be normative, also prescribing a
  particular goal and path to development. Development theorizing tends to be concentrated in academic circles, and hence is contentious and
  evolutionary in nature.
- Development _strategy_ refers to practical organizations, movements and state framework to achieve development, whatever it may be defined to be. This
  is the realm of the practice of development, and although guided by theory concerns itself with achieving agreed upon goals in a medium time-frame.
- Underlying both development theories and strategies are development _ideologies_, bodies of opinions, moral standpoints and normative assumptions
  that form the context for development discourses. There are many development theories, with varying degrees of purchase on development scholars and
  practitioners, but only a handful of ideologies that have evolved over the last century and shaped the underlying paradigm of debate and practice.

## Development ideologies

There are a few ideologies that have held sway over the past century. Within each ideology are many theories and many strategies aligned with the
ideologies.

- normative-economic: The traditional development paradigm which focussed simply on economic growth and prescribed pathways to achieving the "optimal"
  growth for development nations.
- positive-economic: Historical eco-political analyses that shed light on pathways followed in economic growth of nations so far, and project into the
  future, possibilities of growth from present context.
- normative-holistic: Various Marxist and Dependency theories that intend to broaden the reach of development to a wider range of population in the
  developing world and prescribes ways to achieve this via many counter-proposals to liberal economics.
- positive-holistic: Various _alternative_ development proposals that highlight importance of non-state actors and grass-root efforts at self
  determination of the meaning and approach to development. This paradigm remains positive because it accepts a large variety of efforts as long as
  the efforts are holistic and tolerant of opposing views. 


## Science vs Development Studies

Science and development studies differ in how the fields develop.

- Progress in science is revolutionary. Paraphrasing Kuhn: At any given time, a clique of contemporary scholars and their paradigms hold sway and most
  research and progress happens within the framework set by this _invisible college_. Thus there is incremental progress of _normal science_, until
  the point when the number and quality of evidence confronting the status quo grows to a point where a fundamental shift in paradigm becomes
  necessary. Thus there is a flurry of tectonic shifts in the scientific approach. Thus, _extraordinary science_ revolutionizes scientific thinking to
  a new normal where incremental progress once again resumes.
- On the other hand, progress in development studies in particular, and humanities in general, is evolutionary. When a major paradigmatic challenge
  unseats a theory with great purchase, the theory just finds different quarters to continue to hold sway in, or it organically fuses with the
  replacing theories. Theories, paradigms and discourses in development theory never die, they live on in one form on another, intermingled and
  stacked on top of each other. Thus, conflicting ideas often co-exist, and the field accords each its own following and applicability.
