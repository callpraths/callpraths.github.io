Seems apt to start this blog with an old poem I wrote, on an [old
blog][thelousywriter]:

--

There is company in solitude<br/>
When of an evening I walk the dust<br/>
The one within calls<br/>
And I talk with such vigour as never escort'd

When they are around I talk so too<br/>
With a vigour so unlike when on a lonely road<br/>
A vigour to quench the all drowning noise<br/>
A vigour to break the silence of so a many voice<br/>
For there is solitude in company
