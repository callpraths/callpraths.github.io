Seems apt to start this blog with an old poem I wrote, on an [old
blog][thelousywriter].

  There is company in solitude  
  When of an evening I walk the dust  
  The one within calls  
  And I talk with such vigour as never escort'd  

  When they are around I talk so too  
  With a vigour so unlike when on a lonely road  
  A vigour to quench the all drowning noise  
  A vigour to break the silence of so a many voice  
  For there is solitude in company
